Two thirds of electric power is generated from fossil fuels of which half is imported oil and the other half indigenous fuel gas. Since the 1990's power generation is liberalised and Independent Power Producers (IPP's) feed their production into the national grid where the Government of Pakistan acts as Power Purchaser. Consumer prices are set by the Government.

The IPP will lease PV solar energy installations to be installed at the premises of industrial, agro-processing and commercial clients in the Punjab and Baluchistan. The IPP on the basis of long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) will maintain the installations and operate a monthly billing system.

NL-KVK-27378529-PSIP10PK31,Pakistan,2019-03-31,2011-01-01,"Vita Pakistan Limited has found Americana Dairy Llc. interested in joining them in setting up a production facility for (partly) non-dairy based milk powder in Lahore, Pakistan. Vita Pakistan already has second hand dairy powder equipment in place. Despite efforts of 2 PUM senior experts - among others - this production line is unable to produce cost-effective quality powders. This project application is based on the PUM experts' advice to change and upgrade the existing line, allowing cost effective production of high quality milk powder with partly vegetable based ingredients (e.g. pea proteins).

Although Americana Dairy is the official applicant, Vita Pakistan is the initiator of the project. Vita Pakistan and Americana Dairy already have a joint venture for the distribution of liquid milk.

For this project, the partners will set up a new joint venture VITALAC, with share ratio 33% Americana Dairy and 67% Vita Pakistan. In contrast, the financial contribution is divided 20% Americana Dairy / 80% Vita Pakistan. Since marketing of the products is critical to the project, Americana Dairy has claimed a larger share in the joint venture, in exchange of their buyer network and marketing experience. The existing equipment will be rented out by Vita Pakistan Ltd to the new joint venture to underline that the ownership is Vita Pakistan’s.

The joint venture will produce three types of special application (industrial) milk powder in 25 kg bags, with non-dairy ingredients ranging from 60% to 65%. In addition, two types of consumer milk powder will be produced (All-Rite coffee/tea creamer and Hilac instant milk for children). These products will have around 70% non-dairy based ingredients and have higher sales margins. The targeted production share of these two products will increase from 25% in year 1 to 30% in year 7. Total production capacity will be 8,000 Mtons. The fresh milk will be sourced from the market, supplemented by 45 contract dairy farms.



Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

The new joint venture will follow Vita Pakistan's CSR principles. Worth mentioning are Vita Pakistan's good working conditions, their involvement in the Rural Development Initiative (RDI) and 10% of profits are donated to charities.



Impact



•	Long term economic activity

The partners envisage another investment within two years after the end of the project: in milk collection points and cold storage, transport vehicles and new, innovative milk powders. Turnover is expected to increase.



•	Employment and working conditions

The project will employ 111 people: 31 high-level, 53 medium-level and 27 basic-levels. Job opportunities are in production/maintenance and marketing/sales. Two years later this will have increased to 201.

Salaries are at least 25% above minimum wage and increase 10% annually. Preference is given to women and minorities. Free health check-ups and lunch/dinner are provided to all employees.



•	Innovation / Transfer of knowledge

Knowledge about operating and maintaining the equipment and producing these non-dairy based milk powders is new for Pakistan.



•	Chain effects

The project will involve 75 contract dairy farms and create an estimated 120 indirect jobs in distribution.



•	Environment

The impact on the environment will be neutral. The Bag house with CIP system will effectively reduce the exhaust of milk powder to the environment.



•	Position of women

At least 25% of the recruited staff will be women, including medium- and high-level positions.",NL-KVK-27378529,31.5546,74.3572,,Netherlands Enterprise Agency,NL-KVK-27378529,Agro-industries,Industry,Implementation,http://d-portal.org/q.html?aid=NL-KVK-27378529-PSIP10PK31
NL-KVK-27378529-PSIP12PK01,Pakistan,2019-06-30,2012-07-01,"Sea Buckthorn is a berry that grows abundantly on the foot mountains of the Himalaya in Pakistan. It is believed to be a nutraceutical (= food with beneficial health effects). The berries are presently collected from ""wild"" plants, a risky and sometimes painful process. The berries are sold to traders from Pakistan and neighbouring countries. Prices fluctuate strongly.

The joint venture will collect and harvest the berries and process it into three products: softgel capsules, fruit juice and sandwich spread. For the softgel, super critical CO2 extraction will be used to preserve the nutritional properties of the berries. and insert them into the gel as oil. Pakistan and India are major markets for these kind of nutraceuticals. The applicant will design the processes and develop the recipes.

The project will cover the whole production chain. Some thousand collectors will be contracted for the whole year trained and supplied with protective clothing and tools. They receive training from a local branch of the WWF, showing how to collect the berries without destroying the vegetation. Another NGO will provide logistics for the project and safeguard the interest of the local community, making sure that they are fairly paid and protected. If necessary, 500 acres of Sea Buckthorn will be planted to substitute the wild buckthorn. The berries will be cold stored and transported to the production plant in Islamabad, using the logistic infrastructure of the third partner. The production plant is to be built on the premises of the local partner.

The joint venture will divide its shares between the applicant and the local partner.



Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

The critical points are child labour, environmental care and community rights in the area where the berries are to be collected. All the points are addressed in the plan. It also mentions the CSR towards the factory workers, like labour norms, safety and hygiene, and women's rights. Most importantly is that that training for collection will be done together with NGOs in the area to prevent environmental damage.



Impact



•	Employment and working conditions

Salaries above average in Pakistan, other fringe benefits such as health care, meals, transport etc.



•	Innovation / Transfer of knowledge

Super critical CO2 is proven technology but not yet used in Pakistan.



•	Chain effects

Impact on local suppliers

The local suppliers and the harvesters will be able to earn money in a period when there is no alternative work available, as the berries ripen in another season than the other fruits of the area.

Suppliers of kind of raw materials will generally benefit, as most ingredients are locally produced.



Impact on local customers or consumers

Neutral, depending on the health effects of the products. It can be compared to products using Ginseng root extract.



•	Impact on the sector

It will boost the work of NGO's trying to preserve the nature of this area. It will also have a positive effect on tourism: the berries can only flourish in a well preserved area.



•	Environment

Positive. The population will have an incentive to preserve nature. A Chinese company effectively destroyed the berry production by not preserving the ecosystem, depriving many people of a source of income.



•	Position of women

Positive. A high percentage of women will be employed.



•	Impact on government/society level

None.



•	Impact on the local shareholders' position

Positive. As major initiator and investor, they will get most of the revenues.",NL-KVK-27378529,33.7294,73.0931,,Netherlands Enterprise Agency,NL-KVK-27378529,Agro-industries,Industry,Implementation,http://d-portal.org/q.html?aid=NL-KVK-27378529-PSIP12PK01

The project will reach in total 8,968 individuals directly and 9,600 indirectly through a integrated response in Water, Sanitation amp Hygiene (WASH) and Food Security, to augment government efforts to provide immediate, lifesaving  and life sustaining assistance.

MAP's drought response strategy will ensure food security for 1144 beneficiary households, especially during the lean period for at least 3-4 months and improve household food security and nutrition. MAP is proposing distribution of animal concentrated feed for approximately 3000 small/Large livestock for three months, including distribution of grass seed to replenish the feed. The feeding will benefit approximately 600 households  (small-scale farmers, female headed households) affected by drought.  Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) vaccination for small animals and Foot amp Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccination of large animals and deworming will be administered. The coverage of vaccination amp deworming through a blanket approach in the targeted areas alongside 50 livestock medical camps. The frequency and number of medical camps will be dependent on needs. MA will be organizing training's on good agricultural practices for water stressed areas and on improved livestock management practices in droughts to optimize the impact of assistance. For Kharif season, MA is proposing a crop package (including seeds and fertilizer) for 600 farming households to support agriculture cultivation. Kitchen gardening will be promoted in 2 UC's, alongside the distribution of toolkit and training for 100 women, adapted to drought conditions. MA will build/rehabilitate 10 water reservoirs for agriculture purposes. 

As quality of safe drinking water has worsened over the last year,  communities in Baluchistan are depending on unreliable and unsafe water sources, forcing communities to travel long distances to access water, The scarcity of water has also limited safe sanitation and hygiene practices. In response, MAP will rehabilitate 05 Drinking Water Supply Schemes (DWSS) and construct 5 new DWSS, alongside community-based organizations. The distribution of 292 bio-sand filters (Nadi Filters) at household level along with basic training for those areas where people using water from open ponds for drinking (especially in UC Nukundi) will be facilitated. Distribution of 300 sanitation kits for the construction of low-cost latrines of vulnerable households through a community led model will be implemented. Four twin set latrine blocks with hand washing facilities will be constructed in 2 schools and 2 Health facilities. Hygiene promotion campaign will be organized through door to door amp community session and celebration of Global WASH days. MAP will use behavioral change model around hand washing and personal hygiene. MA will conduct community sessions with the support of IEC materials.

In Chaghi, two union councils (Chaghi amp Brabchah) are targeted for life-saving interventions. The affected families are faced with an acute shortage of WASH facilities, food, agriculture, livestock, and livelihood. According to BRDS’ needs assessment, there is an urgent need for WASH and food security interventions to address the WASH and food security related problems of the affected populations. 
Therefore, the proposed project aims to ensure that the affected families have access to improved and safe WASH facilities and access to sufficient food through recovery of their agriculture and livestock-based subsistence on a sustainable basis.  To ensure access to improved WASH facilities, the project aims to develop 6 communal water supply facilities in the two focused UCs. Similarly, 2 harvesting reservoirs will be erected in the UCs, followed by pavement of 6 water ponds to reduce water waste and ensure water availability for both drinking and irrigation purposes. Likewise, to discourage open defecation, 178 latrines will be provided for the affected families in the 2 UCs the arrangement of water supply schemes and latrines will be linked with the delivery of 200 health and hygiene awareness sessions in the focused UCs. 
In addition, to ensure food security and recovery of the livelihoods of the affected families, 750 poultry packages will be distributed among the families per the selection criteria. 1500 agricultural packages (crop and vegetable seeds) will also be provided to 1500 beneficiary families to promote kitchen gardening and agriculture. Approx. 8000 livestock will be vaccinated with the support of the livestock department. 6000 tractor hours will be distributed to prepare the agricultural lands of the affected families per the selection criteria. Moreover, the beneficiaries will be provided 38 trainings in poultry management and livestock, and 175 trainings in kitchen gardening to ensure their food security and livelihoods. Thus, through the above interventions, the project will make sure the affected families have access to WASH facilities their food security is ensured and their livelihoods are revived on a sustainable basis. It will also promote value addition at the local level as a means of diversifying farmers’ revenues on selling agriculture products and stimulating seed demand in the local market. 
To ensure realization of the overall objective of the project, we will ensure maximum transparency and visibility in the project. The beneficiaries will be entitled to information regarding the interventions. They will be made aware of the selection criteria for the activities. A robust complaint mechanism will be developed to enable the affected populations to have their say and register their complaints. Moreover, the project aims at promoting gender and age equality. The above interventions are designed in a way to ensure all genders and ages have equal benefits, share and decision-making in the project. The project also ensures protection and environment protocols to ensure protection of the beneficiaries and adherence to the environment. Thus, the project not only aims to provide WASH and food services, but also aims at promoting gender and age equality, environmental protection, and protection of the beneficiaries.
Lastly, to ensure the project is implemented smoothly in the focused areas, close and continuing coordination will be maintained with all the stakeholders.

The main objective of this project is to enhance the resilience of 6000 targeted families by providing WASH, Food Security and Health support in Taluka Chachro District Tharparkar. AWARE team is already working in proposed area since last decade and based on the information collected during field visit, regular meeting minutes of village based organizations, reports of different stakeholders (government, I/NGOs, media etc), generated a Drought Situation Report in November 2018 and shared with different stakeholders. According to this collected information, Tharparkar received first shower in last week of July (Monsoon season 2018) after which growers began cultivating their land but since then the erratic and inadequate rainfall was insufficient to meet the crops’ needs and sustain the growth of fodder, furthermore the rainwater reservoirs in the proposed area were dried up making people resort to buying extremely expensive drinking water in remote areas. AWARE has conducted a Drought Rapid Need Assessment (DRNA) in proposed areas in February 2019 (attached herewith) and the following needs are priorities from different groups of communities during different FGDs and KIIs
Health:
In FGDs, it is common need of women to provide access for pregnant women for regular checkup and investigation at Taluka head quarter. AWARE did same activity in another project for three year (2016-18) and infant mortality rate has been decreased to 80% and mother mortality rate has been decreased to 95%. Therefore, this project will provide access (referral mechanism) to 600 women of vulnerable households.
Awareness on Health (reproductive, general, mother and children care, Hygiene and DRR) to 10,000 individuals of the proposed drought affected area.
Food Security:
- Livestock support (fodder, vaccination and drench) to 2600 Families
- Seed (millet, sesame, pulses and cluster bean) for next monsoon crops to 2400 families
- Kitchen Gardening Kit (seed, tools, manure and safety nets) to 500 families
WASH: 
WASH services for villages and schools and this will benefit to 1500 families. In this regard, ten submersible solar powered pumps will be installed on dug well in ten villages and a mobile RO plant (on monthly rent basis) will be provided to 30 villages where the water quality in not suitable for drinking purpose. This activity will benefit more than 3000 families in the proposed area. AWARE is already managing a mobile RO plant in same area for 15 villages (1500 HH). According to FGDs there was also a need identified form children for the construction of latrine in girls primary school, therefore, 15 latrines will be constructed in the schools of 15 villages.
During the process of drought rapid need assessment (DRNA), all vulnerable groups (persons with disabilities, pregnant and lactating mothers, chronically ill, elders, minorities, etc) were equally participated in the FGDs. Total 30 FGDs were conducted with 346 persons and the details are mentioned below
-	Boys (5-09 years)           21
-	Boys (10-18 years)         28

It is likely that the provision of improved water, sanitation and hygiene facilities along with increased knowledge and capacity building of target population would reduce target population and school children vulnerability.
In this regards adequate access to safe amp clean drinking water facilities would cater the most vulnerable families in terms of rehabilitation/construction of 2 gravity water supply schemes at community level. Whereas clean and safe drinking water is also the equal right of school’s children and would be provided within school premises.Increased access to sanitation facilities within twenty (20) institutions  i.e. schools and health centers would be ensured through rehabilitation and construction of MHM and PWDs focused twin set latrine along with group hand wash facilities at each proposed institution. MHM kits would be provided once at each proposed institution to ensure the proper management of hygienic practices among adult girls studying in these schools. Along with they will be given sessions through their teachers in order to maintain their health hygiene regarding MHM and handling of solid waste etc. Proper facilities will be provided in dedicated toilets for MHM and PWD's in each institution.
 General awareness sessions in health facilities, particularly school focused health and hygiene sessions would be conducted among school children. The school children including boys and girls would be sensitized about the significance of good hygiene practices. Education for good hygiene practices would make these students agents of change by linking them to their families and community in large. These would be achieved through conducting 75 Hygiene sessions. Added to these 1875 school’s kits would be distributed @75/school among the students of 15 schools in both central and lower Kurram.

Following specific activities are proposed to be carried out during 9 months of the project
	The issue of sustainable access to water, sanitation and hygiene in health care facilities and schools will be addressed through provision of institutional WASH services including safe, gender appropriate, disability friendly and accessible WASH facilities such as twin latrines and hand washing pads with water supply connection and appropriate storage in 30 schools and 14 health facilities. 
	For the provision of clean drinking water, water supply schemes will be constructed by digging bores holes and installation of solar powered water pumps in 18 schools and health care facilities.
	Trainings will be imparted to school teachers and health facilities staff on Operation and Maintenance and WASH approaches. The targeted schools will also receive OampM tools and latrine cleaning kits. 
	Mass hygiene promotion sessions will be conducted in 14 health care facilities targeting women and men visiting the facility. 
	WASH clubs will be formed in 30 schools with equal focus on girls. For effective hygiene promotion intervention Three Star approach for WASH in Schools will be followed not only for conducting hygiene related activities with WASH Clubs but improving overall situation of WASH in schools. In girls schools, the WASH club activities will consist of MHM sessions so that the adolescent girls are not only able to acquire knowledge and skills about menstrual issues but are able to manage menstrual issues confidently.
	To come up with appropriate and sustainable ways to support MHM in schools MHM kits will be provided to school teachers (WASH club in charge) for further distribution among adolescent girls. The kits will be replenished through meager contribution from students to keep it sustainable. Similarly, school WASH club activities will cover MHM sessions so that girls acquire knowledge regarding menstrual issues.
	Water bottles will be distributed among 6000 school children.
	Taleemi Islahi Jirgas (TIJs) consisting of parents and teachers will be revitalized, trained and actively engaged in WASH in school activities. The TIJs will make sure that not only the healthy habits are taught in school and integrated in daily routine but the broader goal of child-friendly school is achieved. 
	The WASH clubs in school will provide learning environment and promote improved behaviors in curtailing open defecation and improving habits of hand washing at critical stages, at personal, domestic and community level. 
	The project will also focus on lack of adequate facilities for girls to manage their menstruation by improving the WASH facilities and conducting hygiene education. Dissemination of health related messages to adolescent girls in high schools will be facilitated by women social mobilization team, with a special focus on promotion of menstrual hygiene management (MHM).
	Development and dissemination of IEC material among school children and communities. The BCC awareness material will also focus on Three Star Approach. Other hygiene promotion interventions include observance of international days like global hand washing day, MHM day, World Water Day and world toilet day.

In these regions some MNCH indicators, such as maternal mortality, skilled birth attendance, stunting prevalence and under five mortality, are particularly poor, with women and children still lack access to essential health services. The regions targeted by the project lack adequate numbers of appropriately skilled health workers, have weak health system management, offer care of generally poor quality, and include communities with limited knowledge on how to protect and promote the health of mothers and children, and high levels of gender inequality.  Project activities include: (1) equipping and upgrading health facilities for: safer deliveries and newborn care, treating infections and malnutrition, facilitating eHealth applications, and improved disposal of biomedical waste; (2) training facility-based health workers and health care managers on topics including human resource management, use of clinical guidelines, evidence-based decision-making, and gender equality; (3) mobilizing local communities to adopt healthy behaviours; (4) providing essential health services at the community level; (5) training health workers and communities to collect, analyze and use administrative health data and contribute to reporting data through government information systems; and (6) engaging key project stakeholders on the results of project impact assessments and their relevance to policy dialogue. This initiative also includes a public engagement component designed to increase understanding of global MNCH issues among the Canadian public.

It directly addresses malnutrition in the first 1000 days of children's lives in targeted districts and informs national nutrition policies in the targeted countries. Malnutrition is the cause of over 3 million child deaths annually and results in non-communicable conditions, such as stunting, wasting and anemia, as well as poor motor, cognitive and social development.  The project is being implemented in Bangladesh (Thakurgaon District), Myanmar (Thabaung Township), Kenya (Elgeyo Marakwet county) and Tanzania (Singida and Shinyanga Regions).The effects of malnutrition in these countries are significant with serious social and economic implications. Such conditions are especially pronounced in rural regions, such as those targeted by the project.  The project is expected to contribute directly to the improved health of approximately 1.64 million individuals, including more than 674,000 women, 553,000 children and 418,000 men, and indirectly reach an estimated 2.1 million individuals who are not targeted by the project but who benefit from the strengthened health system and improved health services. Policy changes in nutrition and wider application of existing policies as a result of the project advocacy efforts also have a positive impact on indirect beneficiaries. The sexual and reproductive health component of this project will directly benefit 1,284,533 people, including 549,182 women of reproductive age and 93,430 children under two years of age.

It directly addresses malnutrition in the first 1000 days of children's lives in targeted districts and informs national nutrition policies in the targeted countries. Malnutrition is the cause of over 3 million child deaths annually and results in non-communicable conditions, such as stunting, wasting and anemia, as well as poor motor, cognitive and social development.  The project is being implemented in Bangladesh (Thakurgaon District), Myanmar (Thabaung Township), Kenya (Elgeyo Marakwet county) and Tanzania (Singida and Shinyanga Regions).The effects of malnutrition in these countries are significant with serious social and economic implications. Such conditions are especially pronounced in rural regions, such as those targeted by the project.

The sexual and reproductive health component of this project will directly benefit 1,284,533 people, including 549,182 women of reproductive age and 93,430 children under two years of age. Other direct beneficiaries include 309,728 adolescents (10-19 year old girls and boys), 332,194 adult men, and 2,148 service providers at facility and community levels. In addition, the initiative’s activities targeting Canadian awareness of MNCH are expected to reach over 3 million Canadians.  Project activities include: (1) recruiting, training and equipping community healthcare workers to promote and provide  basic health services; (2) training local health councils in improved data collection, analysis and reporting to inform planning and delivery of maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) services; (3) raising awareness of primary caretakers on key nutritional practices, including dietary diversity; (4) providing inputs and training in the development of home gardens; (5) training of peer-based networks/care groups on malnutrition prevention and sexual and reproductive health rights issues (i.e. family planning, early forced child marriage, sexual gender-based violence; (6) informing and increasing community participation in policy dialogue with governments on MNCH and sexual and reproductive health and rights; and, (7) implementing interactive media and linking Canadians with empowered youth in a mentorship program to improve the knowledge and ability of Canadians to engage in international MNCH, nutrition, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and gender issues.

The MI works with country governments and other organizations in nutrition to leverage existing proven platforms to extend the reach, depth and impact of nutrition programming among target populations. Project activities include: (1) delivering essential nutrition services, namely critical vitamins and minerals; fortified food products, promotion of breastfeeding; and (2) delivering nutrition counselling and antenatal care packages to reduce mortality, anaemia, birth defects, low birth weight and stunting.

Poor menstrual health and hygiene exacts a tremendous human and financial toll. A growing body of global research links menstruation with school absenteeism, limited mobility, and lost workplace productivity.

In May 2018, the TDA and Action Plan reports were reviewed and endorsed by WBG management.  Following the Government of Sindh’s formal request for a foreign assisted program of support, World Bank management agreed to initiate identification and preparation of a first sustainable fisheries/aquaculture operation in Pakistan, starting in Sindh.

The project focuses on the transitional phase of the emergency response for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of priority roads, bridges, irrigation and flood protection infrastructure damaged by the floods. Providing financing for the most urgently needed works, the loan and grant will enable the Government to redirect its own financing to housing and livelihood cash grants for the most vulnerable groups, thus restoring the economic activity essential to their survival.
